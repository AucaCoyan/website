# Versions

There are currently two versions available:

* The [legacy version 0.7.3 (stable)](/docs/get-started/) is the original one. It's battle-tested and is recommended to most users until the new 
v2 version becomes stable.
* The [new v2 version (alpha)](/docs/next/get-started/) is a brand new rewrite with many new features and improvements. Because it's still new,
it's only recommended to early adopters and technical users, as it might be less stable than the legacy version.
