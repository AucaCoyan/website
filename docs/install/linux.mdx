### Find the right version

To use Espanso on Linux, you first need to determine whether your system is running a X11 or Wayland desktop environment.
If you are unsure, please open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
```

> If the above command doesn't output anything, please try [with this method](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/325972).

Now that you know your desktop environment, you can either follow the [X11](#install-on-x11) or [Wayland](#install-on-wayland) installation instructions.

### Install on X11

> The preferred method to use Espanso on X11-based systems is the AppImage. If for whatever reason you don't like this option, you can also compile espanso from sources by following the [compilation instructions](https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso/blob/dev-1.x/Compilation.md).

import siteConfig from '/docusaurus.config.js';

export const CodeLink = () => <code>{siteConfig.customFields.LINUX_X11_APP_IMAGE_DOWNLOAD_URL}</code>;

To install the Espanso's AppImage, open a terminal and follow these steps, replacing `{{DOWNLOAD_URL}}` with <CodeLink/>

```bash
# Create the $HOME/opt destination folder
mkdir -p ~/opt

# Download the AppImage inside it
wget -O ~/opt/Espanso.AppImage {{DOWNLOAD_URL}}

# Make it executable
chmod u+x ~/opt/Espanso.AppImage

# Create the "espanso" command alias
sudo ~/opt/Espanso.AppImage env-path register
```

From now on, you should have the `espanso` command available in the terminal (you can verify by running `espanso --version`).

At this point, you are ready to use espanso by registering it first as a Systemd service and then starting it with:

```bash
# Register espanso as a systemd service (required only once)
espanso register

# Start espanso
espanso start
```

> If you don't want to use espanso as a Systemd service, you can also start it in unmanaged mode with `espanso start --unmanaged`. Keep in mind that Espanso will not start automatically when running in unmanaged mode, so you will need to do so manually.

You are now ready to read the [Getting Started](../../get-started) tutorial!

### Install on Wayland

> Wayland support is currently experimental, therefore some features might be missing or not working well yet. If you encounter any strange behavior, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso/issues).

Currently, the only way to install Espanso on Wayland is to compile it yourself. Things are rapidly evolving, so expect more user-friendly methods to come in the near future.

#### Manual compilation

##### Prerequisites

These are the basic tools required to build espanso:

* A recent Rust compiler. You can install it following these instructions: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
* A C/C++ compiler. On Linux, you should use the default C/C++ compiler (it's usually GCC). On Ubuntu/Debian systems, you can install them with `sudo apt install build-essential`

* Espanso heavily relies on [cargo make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make) for the various packaging
steps. You can install it by running:

```
cargo install --force cargo-make
```

##### Compiling Espanso

Once you've got all the prerequisites, you can:

```bash
# Clone the Espanso repository
git clone https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso

# Checkout the new alpha version
git checkout -b dev-1.x

# Compile espanso in release mode
# NOTE: this will take a while (~5/10 minutes)
cargo make build-binary --profile release --env NO_X11=true
```

At this point, you should have the `espanso` binary available in the `target/release/` directory.

##### Adding the required Capabilities

Espanso requires access to the `/dev/input/eventX` and `/dev/uinput` interfaces to detect triggers and inject expansions respectively. 
Although you could run it as root to grant the necessary permissions, Espanso supports a safer alternative
that consists in adding the `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` capability to the binary's set of **Permitted** ones. To do so, run the following command:

```
sudo setcap "cap_dac_override+p" target/release/espanso
```

> **Explanation**
>
> In a nutshell, this capability grants the process the permissions to read and write to any file in the system, **but only when explicitly activated by the binary itself**.
>
> To limit the attack surface, Espanso performs the following steps:
* When started, the `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` capability is contained in the `Permitted` set. At this point, **Espanso CANNOT access arbitrary files in the system, as this is only possible once the `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` is moved to the `Effective` set**.
* After a partial initialization of the various modules, Espanso moves the `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` permission to the `Effective` set and opens the necessary interfaces to the `/dev/input/eventX` and `/dev/uinput` files.
* Immediately after, the `Permitted` and `Effective` sets are cleared, meaning Espanso cannot access privileged files anymore. Moreover, because the `Permitted` set was cleared as well, the process won't be able to grant the permission again.
>
> In short, Espanso uses the `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` permission only when opening the `/dev/input*` interfaces, and ungrant that permission immediately after.
>

##### Installing Espanso

Once you've compiled Espanso and granted it the necessary capabilities, you can move it into the final location. A good option would be the `/usr/local/bin` folder:

```
mv target/release/espanso /usr/local/bin/espanso
```

Now run `espanso --version`. If you see the version appear, Espanso was installed correctly and you are now ready for the [Getting Started](../../get-started) tutorial!
